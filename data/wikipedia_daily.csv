2025-11-05 01:26:20 EST,"The Gunpowder Plot of 1605 was a failed assassination attempt against King James I of England and VI of Scotland by a group of provincial English Catholics led by Robert Catesby. The plan was to blow up the House of Lords during the State Opening of Parliament on 5 November, as the prelude to a revolt in the Midlands during which James's nine-year-old daughter, Princess Elizabeth, was to be installed as the Catholic head of state. Catesby may have embarked on the scheme after hopes of securing greater religious tolerance under King James had faded, leaving many English Catholics disappointed. His fellow plotters (pictured) were John and Christopher Wright, Robert and Thomas Wintour, Thomas Percy, Guy Fawkes, Robert Keyes, Thomas Bates, John Grant, Sir Ambrose Rookwood, Sir Everard Digby and Francis Tresham.

2025-11-06 01:27:03 EST,"The sieges of Berwick were the Scottish capture of the town of Berwick-upon-Tweed and their subsequent unsuccessful siege of Berwick Castle, and the English siege and recapture of the town. In 1355 the Second War of Scottish Independence had been under way for over 22 years when, encouraged by the French who were fighting the English in the Hundred Years' War, the Scots assembled an army on the border. In September a truce was agreed and much of the English army left to join King Edward III's campaign in France. In October the Scots broke the truce. On 6 November a Scottish force led by the Earls of Angus and March captured the town of Berwick in a pre-dawn escalade, but failed to take the castle, which they besieged. Edward returned from France and gathered a large army at Newcastle. Most of the Scots withdrew. When the English army arrived in January 1356 the remaining Scots negotiated a safe passage and also withdrew. The English army went on to invade and devastate southern Scotland.

2025-11-07 01:25:21 EST,"""Slug"" is a song by Passengers, a side project of musician Brian Eno and rock band U2 (pictured). It was released on 7 November 1995 on Passengers' sole release, the experimental album Original Soundtracks 1. The song was almost left off the album before it was rediscovered later during the recording sessions. Though Eno made most of the creative decisions during the sessions, ""Slug"" was one of the few tracks that the members from U2 tried to craft themselves. Lyrically, it portrays a desolate soul with the confusion of romance and faith. U2 and Eno tried to create a visual suggestion from the music that was more important than the story within the lyrics. In ""Slug"", the instrumentation is intended as visual music representing the lights turning on in a city at night. The group primarily drew inspiration for the song from U2's experiences in Tokyo at the conclusion of their Zoo TV Tour in 1993. ""Slug"" has been praised as one of the best songs on the album by critics from various publications. (Full article...)",https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Slug_(song)

He gained a first-class degree from Oxford in 1884 and was elected as a fellow of All Souls. Ordained in 1888, Henson served in the East End and Barking, becoming chaplain of Ilford Hospital Chapel in 1895. Appointed rector of St Margaret's, Westminster, and canon of Westminster Abbey in 1900, his tolerance of a wide range of theological views led the Anglo-Catholic wing of the Church of England to try to block his appointment to the see of Hereford. Henson was opposed to strikes, trade unions and socialism, which made him unpopular in the diocese, but some of his opinions changed over time. He came to believe that politicians should not legislate on church matters. He opposed prohibition and Nazi aggression. He supported reform of the divorce laws, the controversial 1928 revision of the Book of Common Prayer and ecumenism. (Full article...)",https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hensley_Henson

Designed by Charles Sargeant Jagger, with architectural work by Lionel Pearson, the memorial commemorates the 49,076 soldiers from the Royal Artillery killed in the First World War. The Royal Artillery War Commemoration Fund, formed in 1918, approached several eminent architects but its insistence on a visual representation of artillery meant that none was able to produce a satisfactory design. They approached Jagger, himself an ex-soldier who had been wounded in the war, and he produced a design that was accepted in 1922. The memorial comprises a cruciform base in Portland stone supporting a sculpture of a howitzer. At the end of each arm of the cross is a sculpture of a soldier—an officer at the front (south side), a shell carrier on the east side, a driver on the west side, and a dead soldier at the rear (north side).

He ruled Egypt for six to eleven years in the early 23rd century BC, toward the end of the Old Kingdom period. He was the son of his predecessor Pepi I Meryre and queen Ankhesenpepi I, and was in turn succeeded by Pepi II Neferkare, who might have been his son or less probably his brother. Pepi I may have shared power with Merenre in a co-regency at the very end of the former's reign. Merenre is frequently called Merenre I by Egyptologists. Merenre's rule saw profound changes in the administration of the southern provinces of Egypt, with a marked increase in the number of provincial administrators and a concurrent steep decline in the size of the central administration in the capital Memphis. A pyramid complex was built for Merenre in Saqqara, and likely completed prior to his death. (Full article...)",https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Merenre_Nemtyemsaf_I

The Whitlam government had been rocked by scandals and political miscalculations. In October, the Opposition blocked bills in the Senate financing the government, and urged Kerr to dismiss Whitlam unless he agreed to call an election for the House of Representatives. On 11 November, Whitlam intended to call a half-Senate election instead, but when he met with Kerr to seek his approval, Kerr dismissed him as prime minister. Before the ALP parliamentarians knew what had happened, Fraser and his allies secured passage of the appropriation bills and Kerr dissolved Parliament.

Probably born in Pauntley, Gloucestershire, into an upper-class land-owning farming family, she married into the well-connected Fettiplace family and moved to a manor house in the Vale of White Horse, Berkshire. In common with many ladies of the Elizabethan era, Fettiplace wrote a manuscript book with details of recipes for dishes and meals, medical remedies and tips for running the household. She dated the work 1604, but it is possible that she began writing it several years earlier, when she was still living with her mother.

It is sometimes referred to as the ""supergiant amphipod"", with some individuals of this species reaching 34 cm (13 in) in length, making it the world's largest species of amphipod. The large body size is sometimes presented as an example of abyssal gigantism, though the specifics of this trait remain under investigation. Its genome is exceptionally large, which may be linked to the large size of the body. The species lives only at 4,850–7,000 m (15,910–22,970 ft) in depth. Although rarely encountered, A. gigantea is considered cosmopolitan and may inhabit up to 59% of the world’s oceans. It is primarily a scavenger of carrion, although the diet varies with age. It has been inferred that individuals of this species have long life spans and can live for over 10 years. Despite its isolation from the surface, human pollutants such as DDT and chlordane have been detected in specimens. (Full article...)",https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alicella

The second son of Genghis's wife Börte, Chagatai was renowned for his masterful knowledge of Mongol custom and law and his harsh temperament. He was appointed to military commands alongside his brothers during the Mongol conquest of the Jin dynasty in 1211 and the invasion of the Khwarazmian Empire in 1219. After the campaign, Chagatai was granted large tracts of conquered land in Central Asia, which he ruled until his death, often quarrelling with officials like Mahmud Yalavach. Chagatai's inflexibility, most notably never accepting the legitimacy of his elder brother Jochi, excluded him from succession to Genghis's throne.

2025-11-25 01:26:45 EST,"Hedonism is a family of philosophical views that prioritize pleasure. Psychological hedonism is a theory of motivation stating that the self-interested pursuit of pleasure and avoidance of pain drive all human conduct. Axiological hedonism is the view that pleasure is the sole source of intrinsic value. It asserts that other things, like knowledge and money, only have value insofar as they produce pleasure and reduce pain. Ethical hedonism applies this view to morality, arguing that people have a moral duty to pursue pleasure. Utilitarian versions aim to increase overall happiness for everyone, whereas egoistic versions state that each person should only look out for their own happiness. The paradox of hedonism and the hedonic treadmill are proposed psychological barriers to the hedonist goal of long-term happiness. As one of the oldest philosophical theories, hedonism was already discussed in ancient Greek, Indian, and Chinese philosophy. (Full article...)",https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hedonism

This species is an opportunistic, aggressive, and versatile feeder active mostly at night, preying predominantly on molluscs and crustaceans. It is also highly prone to cannibalism, which accounts for over a quarter of its diet in some locations. The crab's paddle-shaped rear legs and streamlined carapace allow it to capture prey by swimming rapidly and to escape predation by burrowing in the sand. Its mating season is in winter and spring, after which the female likely moves into deeper waters to incubate and disperse her larvae. Commercial fisheries have harvested paddle crabs since the 1970s, and O. catharus is present in Māori culture as both an artistic motif and as a traditional source of food.

He previously represented Mississippi in the United States Senate and House of Representatives as a Democrat, and was the U.S. secretary of war from 1853 to 1857. A graduate of West Point, Davis served in the U.S. Army, fighting in the Mexican–American War. He was a cotton planter and owned as many as 113 slaves. During the Civil War, Davis served as commander in chief. When the CSA was defeated in 1865, he was captured, accused of involvement in the assassination of Abraham Lincoln and of treason, and imprisoned at Fort Monroe. He was released without trial after two years. Immediately after the war, Davis was often blamed for the CSA's defeat but, after his release from prison, the Lost Cause movement deemed him a hero, and he was celebrated in the South. In the 21st century, however, he has been viewed more harshly, and many memorials to him have been removed. (Full article...)",https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jefferson_Davis

The road encloses Coventry Cathedral, the shopping areas, and much of Coventry University. Except junction 1, all junctions are entirely grade-separated and closely spaced, with weaving sections between them. The road connects with three other A roads: the A4114, the A4600 and the A429. From the 1930s, Coventry City Council began replacing its medieval streets with modern roads, and Donald Gibson, the city architect, began work in 1939 on a plan that was expanded after the Coventry Blitz during the Second World War. The ring road was constructed in six stages from 1959, initially with at-grade junctions, cycle tracks and footpaths, but in the early 1960s the council amended the design to include grade separation and the weaving sections. The road was completed in 1974, with an overall cost of £14.5 million (equivalent to £191 million in 2023). (Full article...)",https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coventry_ring_road

A medium-sized annelid growing up to 8.5 cm (3.3 in) long, it has a spotted greenish-brown back and a reddish underbelly. M. decora is commonly encountered by swimmers and lives in ponds, ditches, and wetlands. The leeches are both blood-sucking parasites and aggressive predators. They have three saw-like ""jaws"" which they use to penetrate their host's skin, and they can remain attached for up to two hours. Their hosts include fish, turtles, wading birds, and mammals, including humans. The leeches are also voracious predators who eat other invertebrates, amphibian eggs and larvae, and sometimes even members of their own species.

A delegate to the Constitutional Convention of 1787, he was one of three delegates who refused to sign the Constitution. His writings have exercised a significant influence on American political thought and events. The Virginia Declaration of Rights, which Mason principally authored, served as a basis for the United States Bill of Rights, of which he has been deemed a father. Many clauses in the Constitution were influenced by Mason's input, but he ultimately did not sign, citing the lack of a bill of rights. His prominent fight for a bill of rights led fellow Virginian James Madison to introduce one during the First Congress in 1789; these amendments were ratified in 1791, a year before Mason died.

The abbot of Fountains Abbey (ruins pictured), Greenwell led the richest abbey in England; his office made him an important figure in Yorkshire. The first half of the century saw the abbey wracked with internal strife, including a disputed election which had violent repercussions as well as, possibly, embezzlement. Greenwell appears to have brought a degree of peace to the abbey upon his election, but he does not seem to have been popular. Downom poisoned a dish of pottage, which he attempted to feed to Greenwell while he was sick. He survived the poisoning, and the case became notorious. Although it took over a year and discussions with Fountains' motherhouse of Cîteaux Abbey, Downom was eventually expelled.

2025-12-18 01:27:55 EST,"A Caesar cipher, also known as Caesar's cipher, the shift cipher, Caesar's code, or the Caesar shift, is one of the simplest and most widely known encryption techniques in cryptography. Named after Julius Caesar, who is said to have used it, it is a type of substitution cipher in which each letter in the plaintext is replaced by a letter some fixed number of positions down the alphabet. For example, with a left shift of 3, D would be replaced by A, E would become B, and so on (pictured). Caesar is believed to have used one in his private correspondence, and a similar one was used by his nephew, Augustus. The encryption step performed by a Caesar cipher is often incorporated as part of more complex schemes, such as the Vigenère cipher, and still has modern application in the ROT13 system. As with all single-alphabet substitution ciphers, the Caesar cipher is easily broken and in modern practice offers essentially no communications security.

The volunteers were often labelled as mercenaries by opponents of the Rhodesian regime, though the government did not regard or pay them as such. They were motivated by opposition to governments led by black people, anti-communism, a desire for adventure, racism, and economic hardship.

It is endemic to a small area of the Sierra Madre Occidental in Mexico. A large jay, it has a prominent dark crest on its head; a purplish-blue back, wings, and face; a white spot above the eye and on the cheek; white undersides; and a partially white tail. Its typical call is a quick, four-note vocalization. The relationship between the tufted jay and other members of the genus Cyanocorax has been a subject of interest since the species was first described in 1935. Because of the visual similarities between the tufted jay and the white-tailed jay, the two were thought by some to be closely related. A 2010 mitochondrial-DNA study has shown that the tufted jay is most closely related to a group of South American jays, despite their ranges being separated by more than 2,000 km (1,200 mi). They are likely descended from an ancestral jay that ranged throughout Latin America. (Full article...)",https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tufted_jay

Al-Muti' was raised to the throne by the Buyids and was effectively reduced to a rubber-stamp figurehead, albeit with some vestiges of authority over judicial and religious appointments in Iraq. The very fact of his subordination and powerlessness helped restore some stability to the caliphal institution: in stark contrast to his short-lived and violently deposed predecessors, al-Muti' enjoyed a long and relatively unchallenged tenure, and was able to hand over the throne to his son al-Ta'i'.

It probably formed simultaneously with Tseax Cone; both were formed by volcanic activity sometime in the last 800 years. The exact timing of volcanism at Tseax Cone has been a subject of controversy due to there being no direct written accounts. There is also controversy over whether the volcano was formed during one or more distinct episodes of eruptive activity. The single eruptive episode hypothesis has been proposed by researchers as early as 1923 whereas a multi-eruption hypothesis was proposed in 1978.

Richard III, the final ruler of the Plantagenet dynasty, was killed on 22 August 1485 in the Battle of Bosworth Field. His body was taken to Greyfriars, where it was buried in a crude grave in the friary church. Following the friary's dissolution in 1538 and subsequent demolition, Richard's tomb was lost. A search for Richard's body began in August 2012 and that September an archaeological excavation took place at the site of the friary. A skeleton (pictured) was discovered of a man with a spinal deformity and severe head injuries.

It investigates different forms of government, ranging from democracy to authoritarianism, and the values guiding political action, like justice, equality, and liberty. Political philosophy focuses on desirable norms and values, in contrast to political science, which emphasizes empirical description. Political philosophy has its roots in antiquity, such as the theories of Plato and Aristotle (both pictured) in ancient Greek philosophy, with discussions on the nature of justice and ideal states. Confucianism, Taoism, and legalism emerged in ancient Chinese philosophy, while Hindu and Buddhist political thought developed in ancient India.

2026-01-11 01:27:22 EST,"The northern gannet (Morus bassanus) is a seabird, the largest species of the gannet family, Sulidae. It is native to the coasts of the Atlantic Ocean, breeding in Western Europe and northeastern North America. It is the largest seabird in the northern Atlantic. The sexes are similar in appearance. Nesting takes place in colonies on both sides of the North Atlantic. Its breeding range has extended northward and eastward, with colonies being established on Russia's Kola Peninsula in 1995 and Bear Island (the southernmost island of Svalbard) in 2011. Colonies are mostly located on offshore islands with cliffs, from which birds can more easily launch into the air. The northern gannet undertakes seasonal migrations and catches fish (which are the mainstay of its diet) by making high-speed dives into the sea. It faces few other natural or man-made threats. Because the northern gannet is both a conspicuous and a common bird, it is referred to in several ancient myths and legends. (Full article...)",https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Northern_gannet

She used her role as a vendor to track down and report several publishers of royalist material.

Born into poverty in Jersey City, Hague first gained office at age 20 and rose through the political ranks. During his 30 years as mayor, Hague's influence reached the national level. His ability to gain huge majorities in Hudson County for the Democrats helped win the state in elections for governor and for president, and his machine dispensed jobs and aid in exchange for votes. He wielded his greatest power under Franklin D. Roosevelt, controlling funding for New Deal projects. Among these were the Jersey City Medical Center and Roosevelt Stadium.

The paintings illustrate a scene from James Thomson's 1727 poem Summer in which a young man accidentally sees a young woman bathing naked and is torn between his desire to look and his knowledge that he ought to look away. The scene was popular with English artists as it was one of the few legitimate pretexts to paint nudes at a time when the display and distribution of nude imagery was suppressed. Musidora was extremely well received when first exhibited and considered one of the finest works by an English artist. Etty died in 1849 and his work rapidly went out of fashion. At that time, the topic of Musidora itself became a cliche, and from the 1870s Thomson's writings faded into obscurity.

They also have mouthparts that specialise towards either filter feeding or grazing, depending on what food sources are available to them. As adults the females feed on the blood of birds and humans. They have an unusual mating system where the males wait on the surface of the rock pools and mate with female pupae before they have matured into adults.

He commanded one of the first hussar squadrons of Frederick the Great's army and is credited with the development of the Prussian cavalry to its efficient level of performance in the Seven Years' War. His cavalryman father retired and then died while Seydlitz was still young. Subsequently, he was mentored by Frederick William, Margrave of Brandenburg-Schwedt. Seydlitz's superb horsemanship and his recklessness combined to make him a stand-out subaltern, and he emerged as a redoubtable Rittmeister (cavalry captain) in the War of the Austrian Succession (1740–1748) during the First and Second Silesian Wars. Seydlitz became legendary throughout the Prussian Army both for his leadership and for his reckless courage. During the Seven Years' War, he gained renown for his ability to assess an entire battlefield quickly. (Full article...)",https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Friedrich_Wilhelm_von_Seydlitz
2026-02-04 01:44:55 EST,"Rosa Parks (February 4, 1913 – October 24, 2005) was an American civil rights movement activist best known for her refusal to move from her seat on a bus in Montgomery, Alabama, in defiance of Jim Crow racial-segregation laws. When Parks was arrested in 1955, local leaders were searching for a person who would be a good legal test case against segregation. She was deemed a suitable candidate, and the Women's Political Council (WPC) organized a one-day bus boycott on the day of her trial. After Parks was found guilty of violating state law, the boycott was extended indefinitely, lasting for 381 days and finally concluding after segregation on buses was deemed unconstitutional in the court case Browder v. Gayle. Parks received many awards and honors, both throughout her life and posthumously. She received the Presidential Medal of Freedom, a Congressional Gold Medal, and was also the first Black American to be memorialized in the National Statuary Hall.

2026-02-05 01:54:05 EST,"The saxaul sparrow (Passer ammodendri) is a passerine bird of the sparrow family Passeridae, found in parts of Central Asia. At 14–16 cm (5.5–6.3 in) and 25–32 g (0.88–1.13 oz), it is among the larger sparrows. Both sexes have plumage ranging from dull grey to sandy brown, and pale brown legs. The female has a less boldly coloured plumage and bill, lacking the pattern of black stripes on the male's head. The head markings of both sexes make the saxaul sparrow distinctive, and unlikely to be confused with any other bird. Vocalisations include a comparatively soft and musical chirping call, a song, and a flight call. Its distribution falls into six probably disjunct areas across Central Asia, from central Turkmenistan to northern Gansu in China. A bird of deserts, the saxaul sparrow favours areas with shrubs such as the saxaul, near rivers and oases. Although it has lost parts of its range to habitat destruction caused by agriculture, it is not seriously threatened by human activities.

2026-02-07 01:37:21 EST,"Aesthetics is the branch of philosophy that studies beauty, taste, art, and related phenomena. It examines aesthetic properties or features that influence the appeal of objects, like elegance and ugliness. Philosophers debate whether these properties exist objectively or depend on subjective experience. Taste is a sensitivity to aesthetic qualities, and differences in taste can lead to disagreements about aesthetic judgments. Artworks are artifacts or performances such as painting, music, dance, architecture, and literature. Art interpretation and criticism seek to identify the meanings of artworks. Discussions focus on elements such as what an artwork represents, which emotions it expresses, and what the author's underlying intent was. Aesthetics is relevant to fields such as ethics, religion, psychology, and everyday life. Its roots lie in antiquity, but it only emerged as a distinct field of inquiry in the 18th century when philosophers like Alexander Baumgarten and Immanuel Kant (pictured) engaged with the subject systematically.

2026-02-08 01:43:57 EST,"Master Juba (c. 1825 – 1852 or 1853) was an African-American dancer. He was one of the first black performers in the United States to play onstage for white audiences and the only one of the era to tour with a white minstrel group. He began his career in Manhattan's Five Points neighborhood and moved to minstrel shows in the mid-1840s. His act featured a sequence in which he imitated famous dancers, then closed by performing in his style. In 1848, he became a sensation in Britain for his dance style, but writers treated him as an exhibit on display. Juba's popularity faded and he died in 1852 or 1853, likely from overwork and malnutrition. He was largely forgotten by historians until a 1947 article by Marian Hannah Winter popularized his story. Juba's dancing style was percussive, varied in tempo and expressive. It likely incorporated European folk steps and African-derived steps used by plantation slaves. Juba was highly influential in the development of tap, jazz, and step-dancing styles. (Full article...)",https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Master_Juba
2026-02-09 02:00:18 EST,"The Mud March, or United Procession of Women, was a peaceful demonstration in London on 9 February 1907 organised by the National Union of Women's Suffrage Societies (NUWSS), in which more than three thousand women marched from Hyde Park Corner to the Strand in support of women's suffrage. Women from all classes participated in the largest public demonstration supporting women's suffrage seen to that date. It acquired the name ""Mud March"" from the day's weather; incessant heavy rain left the marchers drenched and mud-spattered. The NUWSS and other groups organised the march to coincide with the opening of Parliament. The event attracted much public interest and broadly sympathetic press coverage, but when a women's suffrage bill was presented the following month it was ""talked out"" without a vote. The march had a large impact on public awareness and on the movement's tactics. Large peaceful public demonstrations, never previously attempted, became standard features of the suffrage campaign.

2026-02-10 01:59:31 EST,"The St Scholastica Day riot took place in Oxford, England, on 10 February 1355. The disturbance began when two students from the University of Oxford complained about the quality of wine served to them in a tavern; the argument quickly escalated to a fight and the resulting mêlée turned into a riot. The violence continued over three days, with armed gangs entering the town from the countryside to assist the townspeople. University halls and students' accommodation were raided and the inhabitants murdered. Around 20 townsfolk were killed, as were up to 63 members of the university. King Edward III sent judges to the town to determine culpability. He came down on the side of the university, who were given additional powers to the disadvantage of the town's authorities. In an act of conciliation in 1955—the riot's 600th anniversary—the mayor of Oxford was given an honorary degree, while the university's vice-chancellor was made an honorary freeman of the city.

2026-02-11 01:57:03 EST,"Adolfo Farsari (11 February 1841 – 7 February 1898) was an Italian photographer based in Yokohama, Japan. Following a brief military career, including service in the American Civil War, he became a successful entrepreneur and commercial photographer. His photographic work was highly regarded, particularly his hand-coloured portraits and landscapes, which he sold mostly to foreign residents and visitors to the country. Farsari's images were widely distributed, presented or mentioned in books and periodicals, and sometimes recreated by artists in other media; they shaped foreign perceptions of the people and places of Japan and to some degree affected how Japanese saw themselves and their country. His studio – the last notable foreign-owned studio in Japan – was one of the country's largest and most prolific commercial photographic firms. Largely due to Farsari's exacting technical standards and entrepreneurial abilities, it had a significant influence on the development of photography in Japan.

2026-02-12 01:58:08 EST,"Black American Sign Language (BASL) is a dialect of American Sign Language (ASL) used most commonly by deaf Black Americans in the United States. The divergence from ASL was influenced by the segregation of schools in the American South based on race, creating a language community among Black deaf signers at black schools. As of the mid-2010s, BASL is used by signers in the South despite public schools having been desegregated since 1954. BASL differs from other varieties of ASL in its phonology, syntax, and vocabulary. BASL tends to have a larger signing space, and some signs are produced further away from the body than in other dialects. Signers of BASL also tend to prefer two-handed variants of signs, and some signs differ from other dialects because they borrow from African-American English. Younger signers are more likely to have a positive perception of the dialect, as they are less likely to be influenced by perceptions that segregated schools imprinted upon the dialects.

During these voyages, he sailed tens of thousands of miles across largely uncharted areas, mapping coastlines, islands, and features across the globe. He completed the first known circumnavigation of the main islands of New Zealand, and led the first recorded visit by Europeans to the east coast of Australia and the Hawaiian Islands. Renowned for exceptional seamanship and courage in times of danger, he was also a pioneer in the prevention of scurvy. In his three Pacific voyages, Cook encountered numerous indigenous peoples, many with little or no previous contact with Europeans, leading to violent encounters in which indigenous peoples and Cook's crew members were killed. Cook was killed in Hawaii in 1779, when a dispute with Native Hawaiians turned violent. (Full article...)",https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/James_Cook
2026-02-15 01:45:56 EST,"The brass threepence, a twelve-sided coin dated between 1937 and 1970, was the first British coin that was not round. By the mid-1930s, the weight of the bronze penny and its fractions had become an issue for firms that dealt with them in bulk. The silver threepence was unpopular in England due to its small size. The Royal Mint chose a brass twelve-sided threepence readily distinguishable from other coins due to its size, shape and colour. The initial reverse design by Frances Madge Kitchener of a thrift plant was altered at the direction of the Royal Mint by Percy Metcalfe without Kitchener's knowledge. The new coin was slow to circulate when released to the public in 1937, but gained the public's liking, and the silver threepence was discontinued in 1945. A new design, with a crowned portcullis (pictured), was instituted for Elizabeth II in 1953. After the decimalisation of the pound in 1971, it rapidly vanished from circulation and lost its status as legal tender after 31 August 1971.

2026-02-16 01:58:42 EST,"Abraham Lincoln (1809–1865) was the 16th president of the United States, serving from 1861 until his assassination in 1865. Born in a one-room log cabin in Kentucky, he was self-educated and became a lawyer, Illinois state legislator, and U.S. representative. An anti-slavery advocate, he joined the new Republican Party and won the 1860 presidential election, prompting a majority of slave states in the South to secede and form the Confederate States. As he led the country during civil war, Lincoln supervised the Union army, implemented a naval blockade of Southern ports, and issued the Emancipation Proclamation, which freed slaves in the Confederate states. On November 19, 1863, he delivered the now famous Gettysburg Address. Lincoln was re-elected in 1864, and on April 14, 1865, five days after the Confederate surrender at Appomattox, he was fatally shot by John Wilkes Booth. For his role in preserving the Union and ending slavery, Lincoln is ranked among the greatest US presidents. (Full article...)",https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abraham_Lincoln

Completed in August 1862 as a civilian merchant vessel, she was instead purchased by the Union Navy in October. Commissioned in December, she cleared naval mines from the Yazoo River later that month before participating in operations against Confederate-held Fort Hindman in January 1863. Romeo was involved in some of the operations of the Vicksburg campaign in 1863, particularly the Yazoo Pass expedition. Later in 1863, Romeo was involved in part of the Little Rock campaign. During February 1864, she was part of an expedition up the Yazoo River to Yazoo City, Mississippi. She spent most of the rest of the war patrolling the Mississippi River, encountering Confederate land forces on several occasions. Romeo was declared surplus at the end of the war and was sold to civilian owners. Eventually converted into a sidewheel steamer, Romeo ceased to appear in the shipping registers in 1870.

In about 932 she married Æthelstan, the powerful ealdorman of East Anglia, who was called the Half-King because monarchs were said to depend on his advice. Ælfwynn is chiefly known for having been foster-mother to the future king, Edgar (ruled 959–975), following his mother's death in 944, when he was an infant. Æthelstan was a leading supporter of the monastic reform movement; Edgar's upbringing in reforming circles profoundly influenced him, and he became a strong ally of the movement as king. Ælfwynn had four sons, and the youngest, Æthelwine, became the chief secular magnate and a leading monastic reformer like his father. In 966 he was a co-founder of Ramsey Abbey. Ælfwynn donated her estates to the foundation in the same year, including one given to her by Edgar, and was probably buried there. She may have played a crucial role in Ramsey's establishment.
