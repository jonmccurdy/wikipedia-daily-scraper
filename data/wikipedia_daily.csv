2025-11-05 01:26:20 EST,"The Gunpowder Plot of 1605 was a failed assassination attempt against King James I of England and VI of Scotland by a group of provincial English Catholics led by Robert Catesby. The plan was to blow up the House of Lords during the State Opening of Parliament on 5 November, as the prelude to a revolt in the Midlands during which James's nine-year-old daughter, Princess Elizabeth, was to be installed as the Catholic head of state. Catesby may have embarked on the scheme after hopes of securing greater religious tolerance under King James had faded, leaving many English Catholics disappointed. His fellow plotters (pictured) were John and Christopher Wright, Robert and Thomas Wintour, Thomas Percy, Guy Fawkes, Robert Keyes, Thomas Bates, John Grant, Sir Ambrose Rookwood, Sir Everard Digby and Francis Tresham. Fawkes was given charge of the explosives. (This article is part of a featured topic: Gunpowder Plot.)",https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gunpowder_Plot
2025-11-06 01:27:03 EST,"The sieges of Berwick were the Scottish capture of the town of Berwick-upon-Tweed and their subsequent unsuccessful siege of Berwick Castle, and the English siege and recapture of the town. In 1355 the Second War of Scottish Independence had been under way for over 22 years when, encouraged by the French who were fighting the English in the Hundred Years' War, the Scots assembled an army on the border. In September a truce was agreed and much of the English army left to join King Edward III's campaign in France. In October the Scots broke the truce. On 6 November a Scottish force led by the Earls of Angus and March captured the town of Berwick in a pre-dawn escalade, but failed to take the castle, which they besieged. Edward returned from France and gathered a large army at Newcastle. Most of the Scots withdrew. When the English army arrived in January 1356 the remaining Scots negotiated a safe passage and also withdrew. The English army went on to invade and devastate southern Scotland.

2025-11-07 01:25:21 EST,"""Slug"" is a song by Passengers, a side project of musician Brian Eno and rock band U2 (pictured). It was released on 7 November 1995 on Passengers' sole release, the experimental album Original Soundtracks 1. The song was almost left off the album before it was rediscovered later during the recording sessions. Though Eno made most of the creative decisions during the sessions, ""Slug"" was one of the few tracks that the members from U2 tried to craft themselves. Lyrically, it portrays a desolate soul with the confusion of romance and faith. U2 and Eno tried to create a visual suggestion from the music that was more important than the story within the lyrics. In ""Slug"", the instrumentation is intended as visual music representing the lights turning on in a city at night. The group primarily drew inspiration for the song from U2's experiences in Tokyo at the conclusion of their Zoo TV Tour in 1993. ""Slug"" has been praised as one of the best songs on the album by critics from various publications. (Full article...)",https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Slug_(song)
2025-11-08 01:23:26 EST,"Hensley Henson (8 November 1863 – 27 September 1947) was an Anglican cleric who was Bishop of Hereford from 1918 to 1920 and Bishop of Durham from 1920 to 1939. He gained a first-class degree from Oxford in 1884 and was elected as a fellow of All Souls. Ordained in 1888, Henson served in the East End and Barking, becoming chaplain of Ilford Hospital Chapel in 1895. Appointed rector of St Margaret's, Westminster, and canon of Westminster Abbey in 1900, his tolerance of a wide range of theological views led the Anglo-Catholic wing of the Church of England to try to block his appointment to the see of Hereford. Henson was opposed to strikes, trade unions and socialism, which made him unpopular in the diocese, but some of his opinions changed over time. He came to believe that politicians should not legislate on church matters. He opposed prohibition and Nazi aggression. He supported reform of the divorce laws, the controversial 1928 revision of the Book of Common Prayer and ecumenism. (Full article...)",https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hensley_Henson
2025-11-09 01:23:10 EST,"The Royal Artillery Memorial is a First World War memorial located on Hyde Park Corner in London; it was unveiled on 18 October 1925. Designed by Charles Sargeant Jagger, with architectural work by Lionel Pearson, the memorial commemorates the 49,076 soldiers from the Royal Artillery killed in the First World War. The Royal Artillery War Commemoration Fund, formed in 1918, approached several eminent architects but its insistence on a visual representation of artillery meant that none was able to produce a satisfactory design. They approached Jagger, himself an ex-soldier who had been wounded in the war, and he produced a design that was accepted in 1922. The memorial comprises a cruciform base in Portland stone supporting a sculpture of a howitzer. At the end of each arm of the cross is a sculpture of a soldier—an officer at the front (south side), a shell carrier on the east side, a driver on the west side, and a dead soldier at the rear (north side). The design was controversial when unveiled. (Full article...)",https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Royal_Artillery_Memorial
